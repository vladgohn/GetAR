# GetAR - A Stable Diffusion Automatic1111 Extension

## Overview
GetAR is an intuitive extension for the popular Stable Diffusion system, designed to simplify the process of managing image dimensions and aspect ratios. With a user-friendly interface, users can seamlessly upload images and have the dimensions automatically set, or calculate dimensions while maintaining the aspect ratio for further use in the image generation process.

## Features
- **Easy Image Upload**: Drag and drop functionality for quick image uploads.
- **Automatic Dimension Setting**: On image upload, `Real Width` and `Real Height` are automatically populated with the image's dimensions.
- **Dimension Calculation**: Input a width to calculate the height maintaining the aspect ratio, or vice versa, for precise dimension management.
- **Seamless Integration**: Set Size and Set Calc buttons transfer the real or calculated dimensions directly to the image generation sliders, streamlining the workflow.
